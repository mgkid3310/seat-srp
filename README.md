If you have issues with this, you can contact me on Eve as **Crypta Electrica**, or on email as 'crypta@crypta.tech'

## Quick Installation:

In your seat directory (By default:  /var/www/seat), type the following:

```
php artisan down
composer require denngarr/seat-srp
```

(You can skip this step if you are running 3.x)
After a successful installation, you can include the actual plugin by editing **config/app.php** and adding the following after:

```
        /*
         * Package Service Providers...
         */
```
add
```
        Denngarr\Seat\SeatSrp\SrpServiceProvider::class
```

and save the file.  Now you're ready to tell SeAT how to use the plugin:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --force
php artisan migrate

php artisan up
```

And now, when you log into 'Seat', you should see a 'Ship Replacement Program' link on the left.

## Discord Webhook (optional)

Automated notifications of new SRP Requests submitted in Discord

***In Discord application:***

1. On a channel of your choice, click the cog icon to open the channel settings
2. In the channel settings, navigate to the Webhooks tab
3. Click `Create Webhook`
4. Fill in name for the webhook and (optional) image
5. Copy the Webhook URL
6. Click `Save` to finish creating the webhook

***In SeAT .env file:***

The SeAT .env file accepts two variables for the webhook:

1. (required) `SRP_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: this is the url you copied when creating the webhook in Discord
2. (optional) `SRP_DISCORD_MENTION_ROLE`: this can be a room mention (e.g. `@here`), a Discord role ID, or a specific user ID
        - Role ID and User ID can be obtained by typing `/@rolename` into a channel (e.g. `/@srp_manager`) 


Example of .env entries:

```
SRP_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/513619798362554369/Px9VQwiE5lhhBqOjW7rFBuLmLzMimwcklC2kIDJhQ9hLcDzCRPCkbI0LgWq6YwIbFtuk
